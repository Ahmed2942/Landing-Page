## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

### Main
First, I linked between the section data attribute and the text content of the navigation menu and gave it the same data attribute.
then, I built the navigation menu from the sections.
then, I listened to click event on the navigator to scroll and take me to the clicked section.
then, I listened to scroll event to activate the current being viewed section in the viewport.

### Side 
- I made a scroll to top button to make it easier to return to the top of the page.
- I have set a timer to hide the header when there is no scroll in the document.
